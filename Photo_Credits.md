## Credits

Credit and copyright for photographs of _Burmeistera_ flowers belongs to Nathan Muchhala, with the exception of the photograph showing the _Anoura_ bat flying in to drink nectar from _Burmeistera_, which was taken by Murray. All photographs used on the poster were provided by Nathan Muchhala, the owner of the photos, and were used with his express permission. 

The [HybPiper](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper) infographic was redrawn by hand from the original file 'HybPiper_Infographic-2.png' by Matthew Johnson (obtained online [here](https://github.com/mossmatters/HybPiper/wiki)), modified, and combined with other graphics in order to make the infographic at the bottom left hand corner of the poster.
